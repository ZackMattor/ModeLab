# Brand Strategy

## Product Name

- Name: ModeLab
- Tagline: Learn harmony. Sketch ideas fast.
- One‑liner: A key‑aware, roman‑numeral piano‑roll that teaches harmony as you compose — right in the browser.

## Positioning

- Category: Browser‑native education‑first mini‑DAW for harmony and ear‑training.
- Who it’s for: Students, teachers, and self‑taught producers who want a clear, hands‑on way to understand progressions and voice‑leading.
- Why we’re different: Theory‑forward UI (keys, degrees, roman numerals) + immediate piano‑roll feedback in a tidy, no‑setup interface.

## Core Value Props

- Theory‑first workflow: Choose a key, pick degrees (I–VII), and see/hear the result instantly.
- Learn by doing: Drag notes, change inversions, add extensions — understand what changes and why.
- Always ready: No installs, no drivers; built‑in synth that just works.
- Clear scaffolding: Fixed ruler, live bar/beat/tick, metronome, and labeled C4 keep you oriented.

## Personality & Voice

- Approachable instructor: patient, encouraging, and precise.
- Curious and musical; avoids jargon unless it teaches.
- Action prompts: “Try ii–V–I,” “Invert the third for smoother voice‑leading.”

## Visual Identity (directional)

- Logo: A simple staff/piano‑roll hybrid with a highlighted degree and playhead triangle; alternate: an “M” shaped by stacked note bars.
- Colors: Calm academic palette with a bright accent.
  - Primary: Indigo #14213D, Academic Teal #2DA8B3
  - Neutrals: Slate #0B0F20, Off‑white #E6E9F0
  - Support: Mint #31C48D for success, Amber #F6AD55 for warnings
- Type: Clean, legible sans (Inter/Poppins); monospace for readouts.

## Naming Rationale

- “ModeLab” signals musical modes and experimentation. It’s hands‑on and educational, inviting learners to test ideas and hear the results.

## Alternatives (if needed)

- ChordCanvas — Sketching‑first, creative angle.
- CadenceLab — Structure and form.
- ProgressionPad — Beginner‑friendly composing pad.

## Elevator Pitch

ModeLab is the clearest way to learn harmony as you create. Pick a key, choose a roman‑numeral degree, and draw notes on the roll. Loop a bar, invert a chord, add a 7th — you’ll hear the theory immediately and internalize it faster.

## Messaging Pillars

- Start with theory: keys, degrees, roman numerals.
- Learn by doing: drag, loop, invert, extend.
- Instant sound: built‑in synth; no setup.
- Stay oriented: fixed ruler, clean grid, labeled C4.
