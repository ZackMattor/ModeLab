Project: Chord Explorer (Web MIDI)

Summary
- A small Vue 3 single-page app for exploring chords and sending notes via Web MIDI, with a WebAudio synth fallback.
- No backend; runs entirely in the browser via Vue CLI dev server and static build output.

How to Run
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Dev server: `npx vue-cli-service serve` (opens http://localhost:8080)
- Build: `npx vue-cli-service build` (outputs to `dist/`)

Tech + Structure
- Vue 3 + @vue/cli-service
- Entry: `src/main.js`
- App UI/logic: `src/App.vue` (MIDI, synth, chord logic, piano view)
- Styles: `src/assets/main.css`
- HTML template: `public/index.html`

Key Features (reflect in UI/logic changes)
- Output: MIDI output selector, MIDI channel, WebAudio synth toggle.
- Chord: root, octave, quality, inversion, and optional extensions (9, 11, 13, b9, #9, #11, b13).
- Playback: velocity, duration, arpeggiation gap (ms), Hold mode, Space/ESC shortcuts.
- Piano roll: interactive keys; highlights active notes.

Constraints / Style
- Keep dependencies minimal; prefer built-in Web APIs (Web MIDI, WebAudio) and existing Vue structure.
- Maintain the single-component approach in `App.vue` unless a refactor is explicitly requested.
- Keep styling in `src/assets/main.css`; avoid introducing CSS frameworks.
- Favor clear, small methods and computed props; avoid over-abstracting.

Common Tasks for the Agent
- UI tweaks or new controls related to MIDI/synth/chord playback.
- Bug fixes around note scheduling, inversion/extension logic, or Web MIDI state handling.
- Small visual improvements to the piano roll or control panels.
- Documentation updates and small build/dev workflow fixes.

Testing/Validation
- Manual: verify MIDI output selection, synth toggle, chord playback (including arpeggiation, hold, ADSR, detune), and piano roll interactions.
- Browser: test in a Chromium-based browser; confirm permission prompts and fallback behavior when MIDI is unavailable.

Notes
- Web MIDI may not be available in all browsers/environment; ensure graceful fallback to synth.
- Use A4 = MIDI 69. Keep note name displays consistent (e.g., C4/MIDI 60).
